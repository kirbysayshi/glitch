# Glitch Projects

In 2025, Glitch.com (the code sharing platform) effectively shut down. These are the few projects I had created on the platform. It's not much!

- [Image Melter](https://kirbysayshi.com/glitch/image-melter/public/index.html), originally at https://image-melter.glitch.me/
- [Card Adventure (Unfinished)](https://github.com/kirbysayshi/glitch/blob/main/card-adventure/script.js)
- [Alone.io (Unfinished)](https://github.com/kirbysayshi/glitch/blob/main/alone-io/server.js)

I wrote more about these [on my blog](https://kibysayshi.com/2025/05/26/glitch.html)
